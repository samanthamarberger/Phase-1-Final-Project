# My Job Applications

## My Project Description
##### I built this single page application to help job seeking individuals keep track of their job applications, as well as the dates of the interviews they recieve. This application was built using JavaScript. I hope to continue to add to this application as I further my knowledge of web development. 

## Set up
##### The data is stored in a db.json file. In order to access the data, the JSON server must be running. Running json-server --watch db.json will start your server. The data will be stored and visible at http://localhost:3000/jobs 

## How to use 
##### This application works by submitting ones job application information. This includes the name of the company, the job title, and an image of the company logo. A card is then created on the application and stored in the server. This application also has a feature that allows you to submit the date of any interviews. The date pops up when hovering over the card. 

## Here's a link to an overview of my application: https://youtu.be/PUHrZOe8plY

## Now all of your job application information can be stored in one place and you won't loose track ever again!
